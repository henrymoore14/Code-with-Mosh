      //ES6 Classes

      //Classes are essentially constructor functions
      class Circle {
        constructor(radius) {
          this.radius = radius;
          //This Method will show up in the object
          this.move = function () {};
        }

        //Instance Method
        //This method will show up in the object prototype
        draw() {
          console.log("draw");
        }

        //Static Method
        //not avalable as instance.method ... only Class.method
        //these are intended as utility functions that are not tied to a particular object.
        static parse(str) {
          const radius = JSON.parse(str).radius;
          return new Circle(radius);
        }
      }

      const c = new Circle(1);

      //Hoisting

      //Function Declaration
      function sayHello() {} //Convention is to not add a semicolon
      //function declations are hoisted to the top of the code.

      //Function Expression
      const sayBye = function () {}; //Convention is to end with a semicolon.
      //not hoiseted. If sayBye were called before this exreassion, there would be a ReferenceError.

      //Class Declaration
      class Cube {}
      //not hoisted

      //Class Expression
      const Sphere = class {};
      //pretty much noone uses this. There isn't a use case for it.

      //The "this" keyword
      const Elipse = function () {
        this.yell = function () {
          console.log(this);
        };
      };

      const e = new Elipse();

      //Method Call
      e.yell();

      const yell = e.yell;

      //Function Call
      yell();
      //"this" will point to the global object
      //'use strict' will prevent "this" pointing to the global object and will thereby set "this" to undefined. This prevents us from modifying the global object.

      //By default, the body of classes are executed in strict mode, so if Elipse were declared as a class, draw would return undefined.

      //In a private method of a Class, if you want to access the parent class as 'this', you must use an arrow function instead of a regular function, as arrow functions maintain the parent as 'this' rather than the new 'this' referring to the regular function as an object.
