      // Object Prototypes
      //Every object comes from the object prototype. The Object prototype hosts a variety of properties and methods that you can access from a child object without explicitly defining it in the child object.

      //Multilevel Inhearatence
      //Example: Arrays
      //myArray <- arrayProto <- objectProto

      //Constructor Prototypes
      //myObject.getPrototypOf()  ===  myObject.__proto__  === Object.prototype
      //Object.prototype is the prototype of the object that will be created by the Object constructor function

      //Instance members vs Prototype Members
      //Instance members are the members of whatever object you are working with. If there are members with the same name in the Instance object and the prototype object, then
      //this.member can access members going up or down instances of an object

      //Iterating Instances and Prototype Members
      //Object.keys() iterarates through instance members
      //for(let key in object) iterates through all members (instance/own and prototype)

      //Don;t modify objects that you don't own
